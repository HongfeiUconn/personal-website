## Research Interests

* **Business analytics in emerging online platforms**
* **Applications of Machine Learning**
* **Statistical Methodology**

My current research focuses on three main streams: business analytics in emerging online platforms such as platforms for professional services and paid Q&A, applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and statistical methodology. As of the spring semester of my fourth year (Spring 2019), I have generated four completed papers. My first paper is a causal inference study on knowledge contribution in StackOverflow, published at [ACM Transaction in MIS](https://tmis.acm.org/). My second paper (Essay 1 in my dissertation) is the study of a novel form of eWOM, under revision for the second-round review at [Information Systems Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/isre). In my third year, I started two projects—one is about the impact of complications insurance on the demand of cosmetic surgeries (Essay 2 in my dissertation), and the other one is about statistical methods and applications, in which we create a new dimension-reduction method accounting for the time dimension under social media context. The paper about insurance is under review at [Information Systems Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/isre) and the statistical paper is under review at [MIS Quarterly](https://www.misq.org/). Currently I also have several work-in-progress papers.

One of my advantages is that I have experience in both IS-behavior and IS-econ studies. My master’s thesis is a typical behavioral study using expectation-confirmation model to study online users’ continuous participant with structural equation model. My PhD career mainly focuses on IS-econ, but I am still interested in behavioral and psychological study and the third essay in my dissertation is a behavioral paper.
